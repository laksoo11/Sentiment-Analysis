# Sentiment Analysis Web Application

This project is a sentiment analysis and social media monitoring web application built using Streamlit. It focuses on collecting, preprocessing, and analyzing social media data to derive insights about public sentiment.

## Project Structure

- **data/**
  - **raw/**: Contains the raw social media data collected from APIs or web scraping.
  - **processed/**: Stores the cleaned and preprocessed data ready for analysis and modeling.
  
- **models/**: 
  - **trained_model.pkl**: Contains the serialized trained sentiment analysis model.

- **notebooks/**: 
  - **data_collection.ipynb**: Handles the data collection process, including API calls and initial exploration of the data.
  - **data_preprocessing.ipynb**: Focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the text data, including tokenization and feature engineering.
  - **model_development.ipynb**: Covers the model training and evaluation process, including data splitting, algorithm selection, and performance metrics.

- **scripts/**: 
  - **data_collection.py**: Automates the data collection process, encapsulating the logic used in the data_collection notebook.
  - **data_preprocessing.py**: Implements the text cleaning and preprocessing steps defined in the data_preprocessing notebook.
  - **model_training.py**: Handles the model training process, including hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
  - **model_inference.py**: Provides functionality for making predictions with the trained model.

- **streamlit_app/**: 
  - **app.py**: Serves as the entry point for the Streamlit web application, setting up the user interface and integrating the model for sentiment analysis.
  - **components/**: Contains custom components for the Streamlit app.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the dependencies required for the project, including libraries for data processing, machine learning, and Streamlit.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sentiment-analysis-app
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```
   streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the provided Jupyter Notebooks for data collection, preprocessing, and model development.
- The scripts in the `scripts/` directory can be used for automation and integration into production workflows.
- The Streamlit app provides an interactive interface for users to input text and receive sentiment analysis results.
