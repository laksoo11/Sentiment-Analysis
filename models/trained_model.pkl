The file /sentiment-analysis-app/sentiment-analysis-app/models/trained_model.pkl is a binary file that contains the serialized trained sentiment analysis model. As such, it cannot be represented in plain text. You would typically create this file by training your model and then saving it using a library like `pickle` or `joblib`. 

Since I cannot generate the binary content directly, I will provide a comment indicating that this file is intentionally left blank for manual creation after model training.
